Almost _two years_ after my [first experiments with comics on Playdate](/2021/07/24/scrolling-comic-test/), my interactive sci-fi comic _The Botanist_ is finally available to purchase on [Catalog](https://play.date/games/the-botanist/).

The game has actually been mostly complete since some time last summer, but I somehow got attached to the idea of having it launch on Catalog (the Playdate on-device game store), so I've been quietly sitting on a finished game for all this time. If I had known how long it would take for Catalog to finally launch, I might have made a different decision, but I'm just happy to finally have it out in the world.

It was really cool seeing _The Botanist_ featured in the [Playdate Update video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr1_f-Q8Klw) and reading everyone's reactions in the chat. I hope everyone likes it!
