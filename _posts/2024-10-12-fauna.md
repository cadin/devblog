I've started working on my next Playdate comic.

_Fauna_ is an interactive choose-your-own-adventure comic set in the near future. Users can play through multiple times to explore different story paths and outcomes.

In the story a breakthrough in LLM translation technology enables communication between species. Arrays of sensors feed data into the models, converting an animal's biological responses and vital signs into thoughts and intentions expressed via synthesized speech or crude LED readouts.

The comic follows Jun and her cat Polly as they search for clues in the mysterious disappearance of a friend.

I'll be building this with [Panels](https://cadin.github.io/panels/) again, adding some modifications as I go in order to support the features required in such a complex branching story.
