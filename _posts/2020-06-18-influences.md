Some fellow Playdate developers commented that at this point the game reminded them of _Ivan "Ironman" Stewart's Super Off Road_, _Super Sprint_ and even _Rocket League_.

A few of my influences for vibe:

- Atariâ€™s Sprint series, including Badlands
- "Ironman" Stewart's Super Off Road
- Wild Wheels (a [car soccer game](https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/ball-sports-with-vehicles) that pre-dates _Rocket League_by ~20 years)

And for gameplay:

- ExciteBots: Trick Racing
- Mario Kart DS/Wii
- Power Drive
- Richard Burns Rally
- The Italian Job: LA Heist
- Pro Rally
- Runabout series

...so many more, some of which are not even driving games!
