Here's are the [@Playscii](https://twitter.com/Playscii) art files for the Sharp MZ-700 Hanafuda by ZATSOFT. Also includes blank cards: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/7j8lyoi6twdderl/Sharp%20MZ-700%20Hanafuda.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7j8lyoi6twdderl/Sharp%20MZ-700%20Hanafuda.zip?dl=0 "https://www.dropbox.com/s/7j8lyoi6twdderl/Sharp%20MZ-700%20Hanafuda.zip?dl=0")  
  
I'd encourage you to at least try to recreate a few cards yourself as you'll then encounter some of the genius design decisions made by the original creator!
