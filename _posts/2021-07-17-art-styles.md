Despite the fact that I've built a few pixel art games in my life, spent a few years actively developing a [pixel art editor](http://www.pickleeditor.com), and even wrote an [article about creating retro-style games](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/going-old-school-making-games-with-a-retro-aesthetic--gamedev-3567), I've never felt that confident in my pixel art skills. The fact that the Playdate screen is only 1-bit (black or white), made creating art for it even more daunting.

I had struggled through some sketches and false starts in [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org), when one day I happened into a chat with [Neven](https://twitter.com/mrgan) from Panic about comic art. I sent a link to my [Walter Hale book](http://www.walterhale.com) and a few minutes later Neven posted a photo of one of my drawings on the Playdate.

It looked surprisingly good for a non-pixel-art drawing:

Seeing this inspired me to try out some more hand-drawn art styles in my [Playdate emulator]({% post_url 2020-12-18-playdate-emulation-in-love %}).
This first thing I tried was to load in on of my [daily drawings](https://www.cadinbatrack.com/projects/dailyComic/), which were all drawn with pen on paper:

I think this looks great, it just needs a little refinement to recover some of the details. This really inspired me to think about how I might bring some of my drawings and comics to the Playdate, instead of trying to build a traditional pixel art game.

I drew up one more new picture, in Procreate this time, making sure to keep clean lines and clear areas of light and dark to better handle the conversion to 1-bit:

I'm really happy with how this looks. I like how the drawing retains some of the hand-drawn qualities and thick and thin lines, even after it's been converted to 1-bit. I'm going to try using this style with some other drawings and see if I can come up with a good workflow for creating these drawings and prepping them for Playdate.
