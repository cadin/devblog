I've decided to use this character I call The Botanist for my Playdate comic.

I created this character earlier this year as part of the [Ten Hundred class on Monthly](https://monthly.com/ten-hundred-painting). Here's what I wrote about him at the time:

> The Botanist travels around to different worlds searching for ancient seeds to help reforest his home planet. His ghostly companion, Spirit, provides guidance and intuition.  
> He gets analytical assistance from his System Droids that tap into The Motherboard, a central computer that contains what remains of collected human knowledge.

Here's a photo of the final painting I made in that class:

I like the vibrant colors in the painting, but I think the character works great in black and white too, so he should be a good fit for the Playdate comic. I already have a few stories in mind for him. I'm not sure if I'll incorporate the sidekick characters too. That might be something that gets added over time in future volumes.
