title: The Fashion of Fauna
---

The _Fauna_ storyline takes place in the near future, so I wanted to create a fashion aesthetic that feels futuristic without leaning too far into sci-fi or becoming overly ornate. Clothing design can also be used as a tool to emphasize the characters’ silhouettes—helping make each one more visually distinct and immediately recognizable.

## Inspiration

I was inspired by the costumes that [Moebius](https://www.moebius.fr) draws in his comics.
I love how he draws his characters with exaggerated clothing like super tall hats, face masks, cloaks, or big bulky boots. These elements dramatically reshape the human body and feel like extensions of the characters themselves, not just things they’re wearing.

That said, Moebius’s designs tend to feel quite alien or theatrical. For _Fauna_, I wanted something more grounded. The outfits should feel like real clothes people might actually wear, rather than fantasy costumes. So I looked at current fashion trends, trying to imagine how they could evolve into something more stylized and futuristic.

In 2025 I see a lot of people wearing oversized hoodies and puffy jackets. That feels like a wearable, grounded way to distort body shapes in visually interesting ways.

I wanted to try to merge that kind of look with the structured cloaks and vests that are common in cosplay attire.

I also started thinking about the large, dramatic, Moebius-style hats, and how they could be reimagined with influences from cosplay or even furry culture. I imagined a future where cosplay aesthetics have blended into everyday wear, and people might express themselves with helmet-like hats that cover most of the head and face—tools for self-expression that don’t require transforming into an entirely different character.

## Sketches

The characters in _Fauna_ adopt these kind of fashion choices to varying degrees.
Lots of big bulky coats with structured elements like shoulder pads, hoods, and cowls.

And I really like these hat designs that combine a regular baseball hat or beanie with a big comfy helmet or balaclava-type thing that engulfs your entire head. They feel both practical and expressive, like cozy, wearable armor.
