I created a template repo on GitHub with my VS Code setup (for Mac) that lets me build and run my project in the simulator:

## Nova

When I started developing with the Playdate SDK, I tried out Panic's [Nova editor](https://nova.app). It's a very nicely designed native Mac app. I expected to like it more than VS Code, which I only reluctantly adopted a few years ago because it's the tool we use at work. But when working in Nova I found myself being constantly slowed down by the minor differences from what I'm used to.

I tried a few times to get set up developing for Playdate in VS Code. This [Playdate extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.playdate) in the VS Marketplace seemed outdated and didn't work. Tinkering around in the `settings.json` and `tasks.json` got me to where I could build a project, but I couldn't figure out how to automatically launch the simulator. (Nova of course has excellent integration with the Playdate simulator.)

I finally found an old post on the Playdate Discord where [Dovuro](https://twitter.com/Dovuro) posted examples of his VS Code config files. They looked too simple to actually be the answer I had been searching for, but lo and behold they workedâ€”no extension or complex setup required. My template is based on his files.

Now that I'm back in VS Code, I'm surprised to find that autocomplete for the Playdate SDK actually seems better than in Nova. In Nova, typing `playdate.graphics.` will bring up autocomplete suggestions for _everything_ in the SDK, instead of just the things in the "graphics" module. VS Code does this properly, and also provides suggestions for code in my own modules, which I didn't seem to be getting in Nova.

_And_ I can finally once again select a keyword in my code and see all other instances highlighted. I never realized how much I rely on that feature until it was missing. It seems strange that Nova doesn't have this. Perhaps I just couldn't find the setting to enable it.

I do look forward to trying Nova again once it's gotten a bit more mature.
