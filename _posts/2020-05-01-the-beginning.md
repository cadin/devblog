<p>After receiving access to the _Playdate SDK_I took a while to read the docs, and ply around with small code samples, eventually starting to create my own prototypes on <strong>1st May 2020</strong>. One prototype in particular was the genesis of the <em>Daily Driver</em> game.</p>
<h3 id="collector">Collector</h3>
<ul>
<li>Everything is drawn using graphics primitives (circle, rect, line)</li>
<li>Pattern fills rather than pixel dithering</li>
<li>Crank or buttons to aim</li>
</ul>
