I put together some tutorial videos to help folks figure out how to make their own comics with my [Panels framework](https://cadin.github.io/panels/).

There are six videos in total:

1. **[Setup](https://youtu.be/bD7K6Ti-Wpg)**  
   Get the project template and framework from the code repos and get the examples up and running.

2. **[Preparing Artwork](https://youtu.be/qi4WDF-X8Iw)**  
   Export layered images and bring them in to your comic (with parallax effects).

3. **[Creating Sequences](https://youtu.be/jbvt2_GRb1M)**  
   Set up the data files that define the panels and sequences for your comic.

4. **[Animating Layers](https://youtu.be/UYKAldkoQSo)**  
   Make things move! Animate layer positions, create frame-based animations, and apply layer effects.

5. **[Adding Audio](https://youtu.be/qqPXjnM-DOE)**  
   Add background music, ambient noise, and synchronized sound effects.

6. **[Chapters, Credits, & Menu Art](https://youtu.be/aC8kg-T7xnk)**  
   Complete your comic by adding the finishing touches to the in-game menus.

You can access all the videos in a single playlist here:
