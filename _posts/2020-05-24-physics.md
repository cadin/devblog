Now that I was convinced that a driving game could be fun, I was unhappy with the controls and very rudimentary "physics" that the car had. It just didn't feel very real or compelling; there wasn't enough depth to the control scheme.

So I used [Marco Monster's Car Physics article](https://asawicki.info/Mirror/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games.html) (and looked at source code for various implementations of his technique) to implement more realistic car physics including drifting and skid marks. This was a bit of a watershed moment, where I realised that this was the game I wanted to spend my time making for *Playdate*.
